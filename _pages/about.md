Welcome to my personal website!

I'm Yinjuan Zhai, a bachelor of Engineering, majoring in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications from 2016-2020. I am looking for a PhD position this year for 2024 fall in nonlinear optics and quantum optics!

My work and research experience
======
I am interested in principle and application of nonlinear optics in fiber cavity and microcavity. In my 2019-2020 research, I studied Nonlinear Schrodinger equation and boundary conditions for optical field transmission in optical fiber cavity, used Split-step Fourier method and 4th order Runge-Kutta method to simulate optical field distributions and evolutions in time domain and frequency domain, explored the effects of pump power and detuning value on nonlinear dynamics in the cavity, and experimentally locked pump laser frequency to the resonant frequency of the cavity to produce stable ultra-narrow pulse.
